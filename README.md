- 👋 Hi, I’m @marine-kaufmann I have my Bachelor's in both Neuroscience and Psychology, and am working in a Neuroscience research laboratory.
- 👀 I’m interested in Matlab, Python, AI/ML/DL, and subsequently how we can apply aspects of neural architecture to 
     advance the field of Neuroscience & AI as a whole!
- 🌱 I’m currently evolving and improving my understanding of Python & MatLab. I'll be receiving additional training in AI concepts in 2022. Stay tuned!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source data analytics for python projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached via email at marineka@bu.edu
