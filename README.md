- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marine-kaufmann I have my Bachelor's in both Neuroscience and Psychology from Boston University, and am working in a Neuroscience research laboratory post-grad.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Matlab, Python, AI/ML/DL, and subsequently how we can apply aspects of neural architecture to 
     advance the field of Neuroscience & AI as a whole!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently evolving my understanding of Python & MatLab. I'll be receiving additional training in AI concepts. Stay tuned!
- I am currently taking Linear Algebra this fall and will be moving on to Machine Learning soon afterwards.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open source data analytics project for python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I can be reached via email at marineka@bu.edu
